# Marvin

Marvin is a workbench for using and experimenting with Large Language tool models.

## Resource Augmented Generation (RAG)
Marvin will index documents to support RAG.  To use RAG add a `documents` stanza as `DocumentBlock` for all the options.

Please see [rag.md](rag.md) for more details.
